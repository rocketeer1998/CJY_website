My name is Jiayu Chen, and I’m from Xiamen, China. Now I'm a research assistant in Uppsala University with a passion for the development of novel molecular technologies in the realm of biomedical engineering.

I’m particularly interested in:

- Single-cell and spatial multi-omics  
- Exploratory analysis

Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, music, reading, and hiking.
