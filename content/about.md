  # 👋 Hello!
  
  My name is Jiayu Chen 陈嘉驭, and I’m a research assistant with a passion for genomics, RNA-seq, and emerging omics technologies. I'm currently based in Uppsala, Sweden, where I work on developing novel RNA sequencing techniques to better understand cellular diversity and gene regulation.

I’m particularly interested in:

- Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics  
- High-throughput sequencing technology  
- Bioinformatics and data visualization

Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, reading, and hiking.

Feel free to explore the rest of my site, or [contact me](mailto:jiayu.chen@igp.uu.se) if you'd like to collaborate!
